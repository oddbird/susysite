Style Guide
===========

So you're working on an article,
book, video, tutorial, podcast, or presentation about Susy?
That's great!
Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Language
--------

- "Susy" (``Soo•zee``) is pronounced like the common name (often spelled "Suzy").
  It's not an acronymn for anything, so there's no reason to use all-caps.
- The name may be feminine, but Susy is software and has no gender or sex.
  Please use a neutral pronoun (``it``) when referring to Susy,
  and refrain from gendered personifications (in text or images).
- We love being part of a broad and diverse Sass community,
  and we care deeply about the
  `Community Guidelines`_.
  Take a minute to read through them!

Logo & Brand
------------

- Please don't stretch or distort the logo. Obvs.
- The official (pink) brand color is "``hsl(330, 100%, 50%)``" [``#FF0080``].
  The accent (blue) color is "``hsl(195, 100%, 50%)``" [``#00BFFF``].
  The logo should always use our brand pink, or a grayscale variation
  (``black``, ``white``, or anything between).
